# py-xdrlib

This is a copy of the Python _xdrlib_ module, present in the standard
library from release 1.4 to release 3.12.  It is intended that this
module will be maintained with a compatible API and functionality for
as long as it is possible and useful.

## Removal from Standard Library

PEP-594 [https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/#xdrlib] proposed the
removal of a number of less commonly used modules from the standard
library.  The removal of _xdrlib_ was justified on the basis that it
is rarely used other than for NFS at the time of writing in 2019.

The last version of Python to support _xdrlib_ will be 3.12, and the
module will not be part of the standard library in 3.13.
